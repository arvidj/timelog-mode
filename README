Log your time from timeclocks timelogs into basecamp.

Usage:

	 $ git clone git@github.com:arvixx/timelog-mode.git ~/.emacs.d

	 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/timelog-mode")
	 (require 'timelog)

This mode uses the bundled basecamp.el, which is based on org-camp.el:

https://github.com/0x4b/org-camp

basecamp.el needs to be customized. "M-x customize-group" and
basecamp, fill in at least auth token and subdomain.

When visting your timelog, the current time entry should be
highlighted. Move up and down between time-entries using M-n and
M-p. Log an entry by pressing C-c l.

basecamp.el uses a dumb cache. Each request will be cached until emacs
is restarted, or M-x basecamp-clear-cache is run. This cache is never
invalidated, and can therefore be wildly incorrect at times,
especially if you leave Emacs running a while.
